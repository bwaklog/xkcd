The Electromagnetic Spectrum

These waves travel through the electromagnetic field. They were formerly carried by the aether, which was decommissioned in 1897 due to budget cuts.

Other waves:
- Slinky waves [[Two people hold the ends of a tangled slinky.]]
- Sound waves [[There is a snippet of a frequency band. Between 20 Hz and 20 KHz is labeled ""Audible Sound."" Towards the top is a line labeled ""That high-pitched noise in empty rooms.""]]
- The wave [[A row of people does a wave.]]

[[Three parallel scales are across the bottom. The first is lambda (m), ranging from 100Mm to 100fm; second is f (Hz), which starts at 1 Hz and reaches 100 THz about 2
3 of the way along, after which the labels read ""other entertaining greek prefixes like peta- exa- and zappa-""; last is Q (Gal^2
Coloumb), whose labels are 17, 117, pi, 17, 42, theta, e^pi-pi, -2, 540^50, and 11^2. Above the scales and lined up accurately with the first two are the following:]]

- Power & Telephone (100Mm to 1km)
- Radio & TV (1km to somewhere between 1m and 10cm); above that are many boxes showing subranges (AM, VHF, UHF, 14
7 NPR pledge drives, a very thin band for the space rays controlling Steve Ballmer, 99.3 ""The Fox,"" 101.5 ""The Badger,"" 106.3 ""The Frightened Squirrel,"" cell phone cancer rays, CIA, ham radio, kosher radio, shouting car dealership commercials)
- Microwaves (a bit more than 10cm to a bit more than 1mm); it also has subranges (aliens, just below SETI, wifi, FHF, brain waves, sulawesi, gravity)
- Toasters (about 1mm to about 100 micrometers)
- IR (about 100 micrometers to somewhere between 1 micrometer and 1 nm); above that is a bell graph labeled ""Superman's heat vision,"" with a motorcycle driving up the left side labeled ""Jack Black's Heat Vision.""
- Visible light (and, under it, visible dark); above that is a bell graph labeled ""sunlight."" There's a breakout chart above it showing the visible spectrum from 700nm (red) to 450nm (violet). There's an arrow pointing to where octarine would be, somewhere off to the side. Above that are bars showing the absorption spectra for hyrogen, helium, Depends(R) (yellow only) and Tampax(R) (red only).
- UV (about 100nm to about 10nm)
- Miller Light (a thin bar around 10nm)
- An unlabeled section with a thin line above it showing the frequency of the main death star laser
- A blocked-off portion labeled ""Censored Under Patriot Act.""
- X-rays (from about 1nm to about 10pm); a line above shows the frequency of mail-order x-ray glasses. Somewhere vaguely above the 10pm mark is a potato.
- Gamma
cosmic rays (10pm and smaller); above that is a bar marked Sinister Google Projects which also trails off into higher frequencies, and blogorays, which are slightly lower.

In conclusion, on examining the above post by CrackMonkey74, after carefully working my way through the haze of spelling errors (documented in section 3), abuse of capitalization (section 4), and general crimes against grammar and syntax (sections 7-8), I have demonstrated that, beneath it all, the work betrays the author's staggering ignorance of the history and the workings of our electoral system.  While the author's wildly swerving train of thought did at one point flirt with coherence, this brief encounter was more likely a chance event (see statistical analysis in table 5) than a result of even rudimentary lucidity.

{{sidenote left: International}}
House of Pancakes
{{scribbled-out sidenote right: BLOGSPOT}}
Strawberry Banana Pancakes
Four pancakes filled with sliced fresh banana and crowned with cool strawberry topping, more [17] bananas and [23] whipped topping.
[17] Driven by a nameless fear, a whisper in the dark behind me, I flee ahead of I know not what. Whenver I turn, there's nobody behind me.  And yet someone is clearly stealing the ketchup. WHY?
[[The footnote is covered in fingerprints.]]
[23] My life is feeding,
fleeing,
fighting,
and
forgetting.
[[The above note is sandwiched in sideways in between the Stuffed French Toast and Ham and Egg Melt.]]
Rooty Jr.
A kids only [19] version of our house signature Rooty Tooty. One scrambled egg, one strip of bacon, one pork sausage link and one fruit-topped buttermilk pancake.
[19] The decision not to hyphenate ""kids only"" is likely connected to the omission of the serial comma. I wonder if the author is British. I wonder if he sleeps at night.
[[The following passages are have a red substance underneath them, probably ketchup.]]
Rise 'N Shine
Two eggs, toast and hash browns served with your choice [21] of two strips of bacon or two pork sausage links.
[21] {{illegible}} rent a storage unit. Sleep there. Fill it with pancakes. Leave.
Stuffed French Toast
Cinnamon raisin French [18] toast stuffed with sweet cream cheese filling, topped with cool strawberry or your choice of fruit compote and whipped topping.
[18] Nightmares again. I wake up covered in sweat, and what appears to be a thin sheen of maple syrup
{{Handwritten, underlined}} WHO IS MOHAWK GIRL?
[[Slanted 90 degrees left]]
Ham & Egg Melt
Grilled sourdough bread stuffed with ham, scrambled eggs, Swiss and American cheeses. [20]
[[At normal orientation]]
[20] Ordered this in at an IHOP in Rochester, New York. There was blood on the floor. Some of it was mine.
[[Comic strip]]
Enough with your pancakes.
Enough with your GOD DAMN pancakes.
The Big Steak Omlette
Tender strips of steak, hash browns, {{redacted}} tomatoes and Cheddar cheese. Served [22] with house salsa.
[22] Woke up in Las Vegas.  They're closing the Star Trek Experience today.  The IHOP up the strip had pancake platters named after various states.
None of them sounded like home.

All the surviving lines group up at Endor except for Vader, the Emperor, Luke, and Lando; after the climactic duel, the latter two join the rest.]]

[[Jurassic Park. The human characters are in black; dinosaurs are in red. Dilophosaurus appears briefly to eat Nedry and then fades out again. The three raptors are together at the beginning, but split up about halfway through. One has a dotted portion of line between ""locked up"" and ""escapes.""

At extreme left, an arrow pointing down and to the left, labeled ""To Sun, very very far down"". From left to right the gravity wells depicted are: Mercury; Venus; Earth, 5,478 km; Moon, 288 km; Mars, 1,286 km; Ganymede; Io; Jupiter; Europa; Titan, with two small bumps captioned ""WEEOOOEEOOOEEEOOO""; Saturn, with its rings depicted as various-colored horizontal bands; Uranus; and Neptune, with a figure exclaiming, ""An even more glorious dawn awaits!""

Inset below Earth, the Moon, and Mars are three panels depicting Mars', Deimos's, and Phobos's gravity wells. The Mars inset shows Mars' gravity well, 1,286 km deep, in relation to its moons, Deimos and Phobos, and a NASA Mars Exploration Rover. The Deimos inset shows Deimos' gravity well and a person, labeled ""to scale""; the gravity well is approximately two thirds the height of the person, and the caption reads, ""You could escape Deimos with a bike and a ramp."" The Phobos inset is similar, except that the gravity well is approximately three times the height of the person included for scale, and reads, ""A thrown baseball could escape Phobos.""

To the right of Jupiter's gravity well is a diagram of a well. The height of the well is labeled ""very deep""; at the bottom is a figure labeled ""your mom""; and three figures, labeled ""local football team"", are shown falling in head first. Beneath that, the text reads, ""Jupiter is not much larger than Saturn, but much more massive. At its size, adding more mass just makes it denser due to the extra squeezing of gravity. If you dropped a few dozen more Jupiters into it, the pressure would ignite fusion and make it a star.""

At the right of the panel is an inset diagram detailing Earth's gravity well, which is labeled as being 6,379 km deep. Also depicted are the altitudes of low Earth orbit, the ISS, the Space Shuttle, GPS satellites, geosynchronous orbit, and the Moon's gravity well, 288 km deep. A figure standing on the Earth's ""surface"" says, ""This is why it took a huge rocket to get to the moon, but only a small one to get back."" Beneath that, the text, ""It takes the same amount of energy to launch something on an escape trajectory away from Earth as it would to launch it 6,000 km upward under constant 9.81 m
s² Earth gravity. Hence, Earth's well is 6,000 km deep.""
))
Gravity wells, scaled to Earth surface gravity

This chart shows the 'depth' of various solar system gravity wells.

Each well is scaled such that rising out of a physical well of that depth -- in constant Earth surface gravity -- would take the same energy as escaping from that planet's gravity in reality.

Each planet is shown cut in half at the bottom of its well, with the depth of the well measured down to the planet's _flat_ surface.

The planet sizes are to the same scale as the wells. Interplanetary distances are not to scale.

Depth = (G x PlanetMass) 
 (g x PlanetRadius)

G = Newton's constant
g = 9.81 meters per second squared

[[In the upper left corner there is a map scale, labeled with 1 mi (1 km).

Underneath the scale is an antenna symbol that leads down to a blender, an Arduino; labeled with ""Arduino, just for blog cred""; and a chip; ""Most expensive chip available"".

To the right of the antenna there is the symbol for an inductor that has it's lower terminal going into a the left terminal of pattern that looks like a highway cloverleaf.  The upper terminal leads to a line that is going to the upper terminal of that cloverleaf and to a battery symbol (with the + and - symbols on the wrong ends) with a value of â2V.  The right terminal of the cloverleaf is going into a resistor symbol label ""120Î© or to taste"".  Connected to the other terminals of the resistor and battery is a switch that is labeled ""glue open"".  The bottom of the two lines has a transistor with two emitters, one P and one N, and no collector.  The P-type emitter is connected to the top line and a jar of scarab beetles.  Above the beetles is a resistor labeled ""brown blue orange"". To the right is an unlabeled resistor with a center tap going into a capacitor, with a ground on the other end.  Above the capacitor is a diode, and below an inductor.  To the right is another inductor.  The two inductors and ground are all covered by a ""solder blob"".  The rightmost component is a ""666 timer"" that has pin 5 going into a question mark.

Back to the left side, below and to the left of the cloverleaf is a compass rose.  The bottom terminal of the cloverleaf is connected to a battery, labeled 50V, with grounds on both sides.  To the right of the battery is a long horizontal wire that is labeled ""pull this wire really tight.""  That wire is hooked up to a vertical wire that connects to the N-type emitter of the transistor above it.  To the right is an AC source that is labeled 240V, shorted out, with a label on the short ""omit this if you're a wimp.""  To the right of that is an inductor that is labeled with ""11kg"", a batman symbol, and a squirrel.

Back to the left end of the diagram, where the blender is, there is a wire that is labeled as a distance 3
8"" from the wire with the 50V battery.  To the right there is a frowny face, then a vertical wire with a 90 degree bend labeled ""caution â±"".  That leads into a balloon.  Under the balloon is an inductor symbol with a line on the bottom edge labeled as ""warm front"".

Underneath the blender and to the right of the Arduino is a resistor labeled ""ë"".  To the right is an electric eel, a capacitor, an unlabeled resistor, and a gob of hot glue attached to a chip with an inverter hooked to an XOR gate, both with feedback into each other.  Under the electric eel is a neck strap.  To the right of the XOR gate and inverter is a bridge rectifier labeled as ""Moral rectifier""  to the right again is a bottle of magic smoke, under that a fishing bobber and then a broken wire labeled with a question mark. 

Under the most expensive chip available there is a vertical wire labeled with ""electrons single file"".  To the right is a switch labeled ""hire someone to open and close switch real fast.""  To the right of that is a contact labeled ""touche tongue here"".  Below that is a resistor labeled ""5Î© (decoy)"" with only one terminal connected.  To the right of the contact is a methyl group attchaed to a wire.  To the right of the methyl group is a complex mesh of 1Î© resistors labeled with ""oh, so you think you're such a whiz at EE201?""

Connected to the wire labeled ""electrons single file"" is a wire bent in a U shape with an upside-down ground on the end.  To the right is a flux capacitor with the bottom wire labeled I-95.  To the right of that is a wire labeled yarn, then an arena with two diodes going in and one leaving.  The right diode has a ground on its anode labeled ""bury deep, but not too deep.""  To the right of that is a motor labeled vibrator, resistor with a value of Ï, and a 500V AC source.

Under the flux capacitor is a wire that leads out of frame with a label ""â to center of sun"".  To the right is a 55 MPH speed limit sign, then an SR latch (flip-flop) labeled ""may use an actual sandal instead"".  Connected to the Q of the SR latch is a holding pen and to the inverting Q output is a wire in a knot, a resistor labeled ""8mm"", a resistor symbol labeled ""not a resistor; wire just does this"", and a motor symbol labeled ""to scale"".

Under the wire that leads off to the center of the sun is a tangled mess of wires connected and jumping over each other, then a photo diode labeled ""tear collector"".  Under the tear collector is a wire in the shape of a ECG.  To the right is a light bulb, a capacitor-looking symbol labeled 3 liters, a resistor labeled yes, an unlabeled inductor, a resistor with a question mark as a label.  To the right of all that is an inductor labeled ""take off shirt while wiring this part.  Ooh, yeah, I like that.""  Finally, in the lower right hand corner is a ground symbol immersed in a beaker of holy water.]]","I just caught myself idly trying to work out what that resistor mass would actually be, and realized I had self-nerd-sniped.",

Updated Map of Online Communities
Size on map represents volume of Daily Social activity (posts, chat, etc). Based on data gathered over the 
Spring and Summer of 2010

[[Two insets on the upper left-hand corner shows that this map is a tiny portion of the huge continent of Spoken Language, encompassing portions of the Internet, Email, and Cell Phones (SMS).]]

[[The largest landmass on the map by far, which takes up nearly the entire northern half of the map is ""Facebook"" -- with large states in the southeast of the country labeled 'Farmville' and 'Happy Farm'. There is a much smaller state to the west of these called 'Farm Town'. To the north of these states is a large swath of unremarkable land entitled 'Northern Wasteland of Unread Updates.' This is directly north of the large Dopamine Sea.

A peninsula on the southwest, just below the Plains of Awkwardly Public Family Interactions, houses many tiny states, such as MySpace, Orkut, LinkedIn, Bebo, & Hi5. It is bordered on the south by Buzzword Bay, which contains several islands of varying sizes. Among these are YouTube and Twitter (the largest), which are separated by the Social Media Consultant Channel. To the southeast of Twitter, across the Sea of Protocol Confusion, is another, equally large island. Most of it is Skype, with the north having two largish states called AIM and Windows Live Messenger. On the southwest part of the island are two smaller states called GG and Yahoo Messenger.

The Island of Skype is extremely close to, but separated by the Great Firewall (a dashed line), the large landmass of QQ. It's north shore is the Gulf of China and Grass Mud Horse Bay. Outside of these bays, over the Great Firewall are two islands called Craigslist and 2Channel.

In the Dopamine Sea, off the southern shores of Farmvile and Happy Farm, is MMO Isle. Its largest state is WoW, with Runescape, Lineage, Maple Story, Habbo, and the Mountains of Steam among its notable landmarks. To the southeast of the island is the Gulf of Lag, in which sits the CDC Games island, with Eve Online.

To the east of Twitter is Troll Bay, with such islands as Reddit and Reddit, Digg, Stumbleupon, Delicio.us, and Wikipedia Talk Pages. To their south are the IRC isles, of which one is the tiny island of #xkcd.

East of these islands, and north of Skype island, is the Sea of Memes. In this sea, to the north of Craigslist and 2Channel, is an archipelago of tiny islands. There is an inset, labeled 'Forums.' (See below.)

To the southwest if Twitter island, in the Sea of Opinions, are the blog islands. These lie south of the islands in Buzzword Bay, as well. The northernmost islands in this group are centered around the Bay of Drama, on which can be found Diary Blogs, Gossip Blogs, and Livejournal. Gossip Blogs share an island with Political, Music, and Tech Blogs. To the north of this island is a smaller island called Photo Blogs. South of Diary Blogs, and off the southwest coast of Music blogs is a smaller island called Fandom Blogs. South of Tech Blogs, off of which sprouts the small peninsula of Business Blogs, is the Spamblog Straits. On the other side of the straits is a large island made up of Miscellaneous Blogs, with two states demarcated as Religious Blogs and Blog Blogs. Southwest of the Blog Islands is the Sea of Zero (0) Comments.]]

ABOUT THIS MAP
Communities rise and fall, and total membership numbers are no longer a good measure of a community's current size and health. This updated map uses size to represent total social activity in a community -- that is, how much talking, playing sharing, or other socializing happens there. This meant some paring of apples and oranges, but I did my best and tried to be consistent.

Estimates are based on the numbers I could find, but involved a great deal of guesswork, statistical inference, random sampling, nonrandom sampling, a 20,000-cell spreadsheet, emailing, cajoling, tea-leafing reading, goat sacrifices, and gut instinct (i.e. making things up).

Sources of data include Google and Bing, Wiipedia, Alexa, Big-Boards.com, StumbleUpon, Wordpress, Akismet, every website statistics page I could find, press releases, news articles, and individual site employees. Thanks in particular to folks at Last.fm, LiveJournal, Reddit, and the New York Times, as well as sysadmins at a number of sites who shared statistics on condition of anonymity.

977,Map Projections,https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/map_projections.png,"((The comic is one large panel, with different types of map projections listed in two columns. Each listing has an illustration of that projection plus a short paragraph describing the individual who prefers that projection.))

What your favourite Map Projection says about you.

Mercator
[[A drawing of the Mercator projection is shown. In this the world is distorted to fit into a perfect square, centred on Africa.]]
You're not really into maps.

Robinson
[[A drawing of the Robinson projection is shown. Areas near the poles in this projection are fairly distorted, but the distortion is greatly reduced when moving toward the equator.]]
You have a comfortable pair of running shoes that you wear everywhere. You like coffee and enjoy the Beatles. You think the Robinson is the best-looking projection, hands down.

Winkel-Tripel
[[The Winkel-Tripel projection is similar to the Robinson projection, with less distortion at the poles. However the distortion at equivalent latitudes differs as the longitude varies.]]
National Geographic adopted the Winkel-Tripel in 1998, but you've been a W-T fan since 
long
 before ""Nat Geo"" showed up. You're worried it's getting played out, and are thinking of switching to the Kavrayskiy. You once left a party in disgust when a guest showed up wearing shoes with toes. Your favourite musical genre is ""post-"".

Hobo-Dyer
[[The Hobo-Dyer projection is a cylindrical projection resulting in significant latitudinal distortion. The result is a rectangular image with the poles vertically compressed, and land near the equator stretched.]]
You want to avoid cultural imperialism but you've heard bad things about Gall-Peters. You're conflict-averse and buy organic.l You use a recently-invented set of gender-neutral pronouns and think that what the world needs is a revolution in consciousness.

A globe!
[[It's a globe.]]
Yes, you're very clever.

Pierce Quincuncial
[[This is a square projection centred over the north pole. The continents stretch out radially from the centre of the map and bits of Antarctica are visible in each corner of the projection.]]
You think that when we look at a map, what we really see is ourselves. After you first saw 
Inception
, you sat silent in the theater for six hours. It freaks you out to realise that everyone around you has a skeleton inside them. You 
have
 really looked at your hands.

((The second column of projections starts here.))

Van Der Grinten
[[This projection displays the continents inside a perfectly circular frame. The continents are displayed with similar distortion to what you would see in the Robinson or Winkel-Tripel projections.]]
You're not a complicated person. You love the Mercator projection; you just wish it weren't so square. The earth's not a square, it's a circle. You like circles. Today is gonna be a good day!

Dymaxion
[[The Dymaxion projection attempts to unfold the earth into a polyhedral net, centred on the north pole. The map has no set shape, instead it looks to be made out of a series of triangles.]]
You like Isaac Asimov, XML, and shoes with toes. You think the segway got a bad rap. You own 3D goggles, which you use to view rotating models of better 3D goggles. You type in Dvorak.

Goode Homolosine
[[The Goode Homolosine projection attempts to minimise distortion by combining two equal area projections onto a split projection. The map resembles a smooth unfolded net, with landmasses kept whole where possible.]]
They say mapping the earth on a 2D surface is like flattening an orange peel, which seems easy enough to you. You like easy solutions. You think we wouldn't have so many problems if we'd just elect 
normal
 people to congress instead of politicians. You think airlines should just buy food from the restaurants near the gates and serve 
that
 on board. You change your car's oil, but secretly wonder if you really 
need
 to.

Plate Carrée
(Equirectangular)
[[This projection maps latitude and longitude to a rectangular grid, leading to significant longitudinal distortion near the poles.]]
You think this one is fine. You like how 
x
 and 
y
 map to latitude and longitude. The other projections overcomplicate things. You want me to stop asking about maps so you can enjoy dinner.

Waterman Butterfly
[[This projection unfolds the world into a net, similar to the Dymaxion projection. It is centred on the Atlantic, and resembles a butterfly with the Americas on the western wing, with Europe and Africa on the eastern wing.]]
Really? You know the Waterman? Have you seen the 1909 Cahill map it's based-- ...You have a framed reproduction at home?! Whoa. ...Listen, forget these questions. Are you doing anything tonight?

Gall-Peters
[[Another rectangular projection, this map suffers significant distortion near the poles, and significant latitudinal distortion in general.]]
I 
hate
 you.

Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious

[[Each panel shows a member of a different major.  First up is a philosopher.]]
Philosophy's just math sans rigor, sense, and practicality

And math's just physics unconstrained by precepts of reality.

A business major's just a thing you get so you can graduate

And chemistry's for stamp collectors high on methylacetate.

Why anyone who wants a job would study lit's a mystery

Unless their only other choice were something like art history.

A BA in communications guarantees that you'll achieve

A little less than if you'd learned to underwater basket-weave

I'd rather eat a Fowler's Toad than major in biology,
<<Ribbit>>

And social psych is worse than either psych 
or
 sociology.

The thought of picking any one of these is too unbearable.

Now, if you can't prognosticate, that's ok in seismology,

But if your hindsight's weak as well, you'd best stick to theology.

CS will make each day a quest to find a missing close-paren.

Virology will guarantee you'll never get a hug again.

I.T. prepares you for a life of fighting with PCs nonstop.

As Pratchett said, 
Terry Pratchett: ""Geography's just physics slowed with trees on top.""

Though physics seems to promise you a Richard Feynman-like career,

The Wiki page for ""Physics Major"" redirects to 
""Engineer.""


They say to study history or find yourself repeating it,

But all that it prepares you for is forty years of teaching it.

[[And back to the explanation at the desk.]]
I recognize my four-year plan's at this point not repairable,

But put me down as ""Undecided"" -- every major's terrible.

[[More pictures of majors.  The astronomer appears to be the Bad Astronomer]]
Astronomers all cringe when they hear ""supermoon"" or ""zodiac,""

Agronomy's a no-go; I'm a huge agorophobiac.

The 2005 Atlantic hurricane season saw devastating storms like Katrina and Rita. But less well-remembered is just how 
strange
 the season got toward the end.
The forecasters at the National Hurricane Center are the best of the best.
Their predictions are masterpieces of professional analysis. But in November 2005, out in the center of the Atlantic - far from any land - the atmosphere stopped making sense.
And the forecasters - who'd expected the season to be long over by now - started to get a little unhinged.
This is their story, as seen through the actual 2005 NHC Advisories:

[[Two men, one bald and one not, sit looking at their respective computers, at separate desks, back to back. The advisory is printed above them in caps
small-caps Courier type.]]
Tuesday, November 29th, 2005: 
Tropical Storm Epsilon . . .
The 26th named storm of the apparently never ending 2005 Atlantic hurricane season.

[[The same scene, different text.]]
10 PM Wed: The window of opportunity for strengthening should close in 12-24 hr.
4 PM Thu: Slow but steady weakening is expected to begin in 12-24 hours.

[[The man with hair now has questions marks above his head.]]
4 AM Fri: Epsilon does not appear weaker.
10 AM Fri: Epsilon has been upgraded to a 65-kt hurricane.

[[The two still sit back-to-back.]]
4 PM Sat: Epsilon has continued to strengthen against all odds . . . [but] can not maintain the current intensity much longer since the environment is becoming increasingly unfavorable.

[[Ditto.]]
10 PM Sat: Epsilon might or might not still be a hurricane . . . but in any case it likely will not be one on Sunday.
4 AM Sun: Epsilon is downgraded to a tropical storm. 

[[Yep.]]
10 AM Sun: Morning satellite images indicate that Epsilon has restrengthened.

[[A closer view of just the balding man at his desk.]]
There are no clear reasons . . . and I am not going to make one up . . . to explain the recent strengthening of Epsilon and I am just describing the facts.
However . . . I still have to make an intensity forecast and the best bet at this time is to predict weakening . . . Epsilon will likely become a remnant low.
I heard that before about epsilon . . . haven't you?

[[The two men still sit back to back, but the man with hair is now turning his head toward the other man, with his arm resting on the back of his chair. The bald man is leaning forward in his seat, toward his computer while typing.]]
4 PM Mon: The cloud pattern continues to be remarkably well-organized for a hurricane at such high latitude
in December.

[[The other man has turned back to his own screen.]]
10 PM Mon: We have said this before . . . but Epsilon really does not appear as strong this evening as it did this afternoon.

[[Just the bald guy now.]]
4 AM Tue: 
I have run out of things to say.

[[The two of them again.]]
10 PM Tue: The end is in sight. It really really is. But in the meantime . . . Epsilon continues to maintain hurricane status. 
4 AM Wed: The end is in sight . . . yes . . . but not quiet yet. I thought I was going to find a weakening system and instead I found that Epsilon is still a hurricane.

[[Ditto.]]
10 AM  Thu: Convection has vanished and Epsilon is now a tight swirl of low clouds.
I hope this is the end of the long lasting 2005 hurricane season.

Friday, December 30th, 2005: An elongated area of low pressure . . . which ahd its origins in an old frontal trough . . . began developing organized convection overnight. Advisories are initiated on the 27th tropical storm of 2005.

Any new storms would be in the 2006 season.
[[The men are still at their desks, the man with hair is even more bedraggled-looking.]]
4PM Fri: Although the atmosphere seems to want to develop tropical storms ad nauseam . . . the calendar will shortly put an end to the use of the Greek alphabet to name them.

But 2005's wouldn't end until Zeta did.
[[The bald man is now wearing a party hat and there is confetti in the air.]]
10 PM Sat: Zeta appeared on the verge of losing all of its deep convection a few hours ago . . . but since about 21z the convection has been on somewhat of an increase again.

[[A close view of the man with hair at his desk.]]
10 PM Sun: This is like Epsilon all over again. Most of the conventional guidance suggested that zeta should have been dissipated by now . . . well . . . zeta is pretty much alive at this time. 
I have no choice but to forecast weakening
again and again.

[[Both of them at their desks.]]
4 AM Mon: By 24-36 hours . . . a significant increase in westerly winds . . . should act to shear away most of the associated convection . . . and finally bring the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season to a merciful ending.
4 PM Mon: It is hard to conceive that a tropical cyclone will be able to survive for very long in such a hostile environment. therefore I have not backed off on the forecast of weakening.

[[And again.]]
10 PM Mon: Zeta is stronger than yesterday.
10 AM Wed: As you can see. . . I ran out of things to say.

[[And again.]]
4 AM Thu: Satellite intensity estimates have decreased. Zeta is downgraded to a 30 kt tropical depression.

[[And again.]]
10 AM Thu: Shortly after the previous advisory had been issued . . . regretfully . . . the intensity . . . increased to 35 kt and Zeta is a tropical storm once again.

[[And again.]]
10 PM Thu: Although it seems as if Zeta will never die . . . the forecast continues to show weakening.

[[Both men are now leaning back in their chairs, exhausted.]]
4 PM, Friday, January 6, 2006: Zeta no longer meets the criteria of a tropical cyclone. . . which means that both it and the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season have ended. 
This is the national hurricane center signing off for 2005.

[[The bald man still sits at his desk, the man with hair is no longer in his chair.]]

[[Again, we see the bald man at his desk and the other guy's empty desk.]]

*The art of letter-writing is fast dying out.* When a letter cost nine pence, it seemed but fair to try to make it worth nine pence... Now, however, we think we are too busy for such old-fashioned correspondence. *We fire off a multitude of rapid and short notes, instead of sitting down to have a good talk over a real sheet of paper.*
-- The Sunday Magazine
1871

It is, unfortunately, one of the chief characteristics of modern business to be always in a hurry. *In olden times it was different.*
-- The Medical Record
1884

With the advent of cheap newspapers and superior means of locomotion... the dreamy quiet old days are over... for *men now live think and work at express speed.* They have their 
Mercury
 or 
Post
 laid on their breakfast table in the early morning, and if they are too hurried to snatch from it the news during that meal, they carry it off, to be *sulkily read as they travel... leaving them no time to talk with the friend who may share the compartment with them*... the hurry and bustle of modern life... lacks the quiet and repose of the period when our forefathers, the day's work done, took their ease...
-- William Smith, Morley: Ancient and Modern
1886

Conversation is said to be a lost art... good talk presupposes leisure, both for preparation and enjoyment. *The age of leisure is dead, and the art of conversation is dying.*
-- Frank Leslie's Popular Monthly, volume 29
1890

Intellectual laziness and the hurry of the age have produced *a craving for literary nips*. The torpid brain... has grown too weak for sustained thought. 
*There never was an age in which so many people were able to write badly*. 
-- Israel Zangwill, The Bachelors' Club
1891

*The art of pure line engraving is dying out. We live at too fast a rate* to allow for the preparation of such plates as our fathers appreciated. If a picture catches the public fancy, the public must have an etched or a photogravured copy of it within a month or two of its appearance. The days when engravers were wont to spend two or three years over a single plate are for ever gone. 
-- Journal of the Institute of Jamaica, volume 1
1892

So much is exhibited to the eye that *nothing is left to the imagination*. It seems almost possible that the modern world might be choked by its own riches, *and human faculty dwindle away amid the million inventions that ahve been introduced to render its exercise unnecessary*.
The articles in the quarterlies extend to thirty or more pages, but *thirty pages is now too much*. So we witness a further condensing process and, we have the 
fortnightly

*To take sufficient time for our meals seems frequently impossible* on account of the demands on our time made by our business... we act on the apparent belief that all of our business is so pressing that we must jump on the quickest car home, eat our dinner in the most hurried way, make the closest connection for car returning...

1902

The art of conversation is almost a lost one. *People talk as they ride bicycles - at a rush - without pausing to consider their surroundings*... What has been generally understood as cultured society is rapidly deteriorating into baseness and voluntary ignorance. *The profession of letters is so little understood*, and so far from being seriously appreciated, that... newspapers are full, not of thoughtful honestly expressed public opinion on the affairs of the nation, but of vapid personalities interesting to none save gossips and busy bodies.

1908

We write millions more letters than did our grandfathers, but the increase in volume has brought with it an automatic artificial machine-like ring... an examination of a file of old letters reveals not only a remarkable grasp of details, but a *fitness and courtliness too often totally lacking* in the mechanical curt cut and dried letters of to-day.

(1883)","‘the art of letter-writing is fast dying out. when a letter cost nine pence, it seemed but fair to try to make it worth nine pence .. now, however, we think we are too busy for such old-fashioned correspondence. we fire off a multitude of rapid and short notes, instead of sitting down to have a good talk over a real sheet of paper. itis, unfortunately, one of the chief

over ... for men now live think and work at express speed. they have their mercury or post laid on their breakfast table. in the early morning, and if they are. too hurried to snatch from it the news during that meal, they carry it off, to be sulkily read as they travel ... leaving them no time to talk with the friend who may share the compartment with them .. the hurry and bustle of modern life .. lacks the quiet and repose of the period when our forefathers, the day's work done, took their ease. 1886 conversation is said to be a lost art .. good talk presupposes leisure, goth for preparation and enjoyment. the age of leisure is dead, and the art of conversation is dying. 1870 intellectual laziness and the hurry of the age have produced a craving for literary nips. the torpid grain .. has grown too weak for sustained thought. there never was an age in which so many people were able to write badly. 1871 the art of pure line engraving is dying out. we live at too. fast a rate to allow for the preparation of such plates as our fathers appreciated. if a picture catches the public fancy, the public must have an etched or a photogravured copy of it within a month or two of its appearance, the days when engravers were wont to spend two or three years: over a single plate are for ever gone. so much is exhibited to the eye that nothing is left to the imagination. it sometimes seems almost possible that the modern world might be choked by its own riches, and human faculty dwindle away amid the million inventions that have been introduced to render its exercise unnecessary. ‘the articles in the quarterlies extend to thirty or more pages, but thirty pages is now too much. so we witness a. further condensing process and, we have the fortnightly and the

Today, the full set of Safire's contingency speeches has been found.

((First speech))
In Event Astronauts Stranded On Moon
Fate has ordained that the men who went to the moon to explore in peace will stay on the moon to rest in peace.

In ancient days, men looked at stars and saw their heroes in the constellations. In modern times, we do the same, but our heroes are epic men of flesh and blood.

Others will follow, and surely find their way home. Man's search will not be denied. But these men were the first, and they will remain the foremost in our hearts. For every human being who looks up at the moon in the nights to come will know that there is some corner of another world that is forever-- <<notes are truncated>>

((Second speech))
In Event Spacecraft Goes Missing
Neil Armstrong, Edwin Aldrin, and Michael Collins went to the moon as ambassadors of peace for all mankind, and all mankind prays that they may yet return safely home.

We are separated from the moon by a vast gulf of space, against which their tiny vessel appeared as but a drifting speck. For a few brief seconds, we took our eye off them, and despite days of desperate searching, never again was their vessel sighted from Earth.

While these men are lost they are not forgotten and their sacrifice will not-- <<notes are truncated>>

((Third speech))
In Event Astronauts Abscond With Spacecraft
We do not know what led Armstrong, Aldrin and Collins to betray the trust we placed in them, abandon their mission, and steer their vessel toward Mars. Nor do we know what compelled them to transmit such hurtful messages back to earth, heaping contempt on their onetime home.

But whatever the cause of their dereliction, I call upon the United States to commit itself, before this year is out, to launching a mission to chase down Apollo 11 and return its crew to face Justice. We must not rest until-- <<notes are truncated>>

((Fourth speech))
In Event Spacecraft Returns With Extra Astronauts
While this is much we do not understand, tonight all of Earth is united in celebrating the safe return of our brave explorers.

We of course have many questions, and in the day and weeks to come we will demand answers. How many souls were truly aboard Apollo 11 when it launched? Who are the six men now in quarantine aboard the USS Hornet? What happened-- <<notes are truncated>>

In Event Spacecraft Hits U.S.S. Hornet, Crushing Nixon

President Agnew: Tonight, we have experienced a great national triumph and a great national loss. We take joy in the safe return from the moon of Neil Armstrong, Edwin Aldrin, and Michael Collins, but that joy is tempered with sorrow as we mourn our president's tragic death beneath their wayward capsule.

Richard Nixon wholeheartedly supported our courageous astronauts as they carried the hopes and prayers of Earth to the heavens, and in the moment of their homecoming, he himself has departed on that ultimate voyage.

and every listener interprets those signals in their own way.

Language isn't a formal system. Language is a glorious chaos.

You can never know for sure what ANY words will mean to ANYONE.

All you can do is try to get better at guessing how your words affect people, so you can have a chance of finding the ones that will make them feel something like what you want them to feel.

Everything else is pointless.

I assume you're giving me tips on how you interpret words because you want me to feel less alone.

If so, then thank you.

That means a lot.
