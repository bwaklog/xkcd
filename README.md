## Cool stuff: 
<a name="cool-stuff"></a>
- currently has quick look integration 🤯🤯

## Yet to come 
<a name="yet-to-come"></a>
- _Create a web interface using **flask**._..<br />
  May or may not go ahead with this option cuz using the website is a better option🫠, but here is what I want to achieve by creating a local running web interface (or hopefully one hosted on something like heroku which is a pain to work with)
  - 💾 Local Storage options for comics
  - ❤️ Creating Bookmark/Liking features
  - 📩 Creating a sharing option. Send your favorite comics to your friends with a few clicks!
  - Umm...A neat interface cuz I don't want get myself using tkinter or some other boring looking tool.
- There was supposed to be an `install.sh` script to add the `xkcd.sh` script to your alias but that didn't seem to work cuz idk how to do that

## Requirements 
<a name="requirements"></a>
What i'm using for this program:
- This isn't really a disclaimer but if you don't have quick-look (MacOS only), that's no problem! But for now all you get is:
  - 🔗 A link to the image of the post. You can open it in your default browser
  - A _very very very_ descriptive info of the post you requested for ツ
- Yeah, I haven't used this on a windows pc so far, and some of these..._**most of these**_ commands are _UNIX_ commands so, **join the the Force with BASH 🕺**
- running this in a venv for development, so do make sure you install all the requirements from `requirements.txt`
- That's it for now...nothing else to force you to install..**other than python3**🐍
