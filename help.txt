usage: xkcd [ -l | --latest | <comic num>] 
            [ -q | --ql ] [-h | --help ]

These are some of the xkcd commands that can be 
used in various situations

To fetch comics
[ -l | --latest ]               This is flag passed to fetch the latest comic
[ <valid comic number: int> ]   Pass a valid integer to get that comic num

Using quick Look ( 🍎 MacOS only )
[ -q | --ql ]                   This creates a buffer image to show the comic
                                instead of clicking the external link
